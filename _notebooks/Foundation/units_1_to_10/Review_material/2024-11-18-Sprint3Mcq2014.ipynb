    "Correct Answer: C\n",
    "Reason: I was being careless and forgot that both variables are integers so when you divide them it will stay an Integer. Next time I will read more carefully since this is a completely avoidable mistake.\n",
    "\n",

    "Question 8\n",
    "![Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 3 58 40 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74a4d823-2a68-4459-8cc3-abfd632aae91)\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "Reason: I was again being careless and misread the code forgetting about the constructor with no parameters required.\n",

    "Question 10\n",
    "![Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 4 00 49 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b0b84b-5184-4605-9635-d53266d70fb6)\n",
    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "Reason: I was a bit silly here since I forgot how if there is no target within data and we try searching for it it will never be found and it will be a stack overflow error likely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question 12\n",
    "![Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 4 04 05 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/865654df-5ec3-4c1d-88ad-06afdfe5e50d)\n",
    "Correct Answer: C\n",
    "Reason: I again misread the code and forgot to see the index of 1 which was the starting value of the for loop. \n",

    "Question 15\n",
    "![Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 4 05 00 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a7ad60b-2e04-4e3a-bec4-c9856fa638c9)\n",
    "Correct Answer: A\n",
    "Reason: I again was being not very intelligent when I misread the last possible or end bound value for the index in the forloop as it does k+1 which will throw an out-of-bounds error for option 2. \n",

    "Correct Answer: C\n",
    "Reason: I was again being a bit silly since I forgot that the -1 of that index will make it the end of the first part and mess up the combined array.\n",

    "![Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 4 18 50 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc6f3ddd-eda4-480a-891a-c03bf9e17900)\n",
    "Correct Answer: D\n",
    "Reason: I had misread the answer choice since there is an or operator in between the 2 conditions so I should definitely reading better. \n",

    "Correct Answer: B\n",
    "Reason: This one was actually a bit tricky but I believe it is because it still adds it to the end of the list. \n",
