Presenting my project not only helped me receive useful input but also sparked a new idea for a potential application I hadn’t considered before. Demonstrating the project highlighted parts that felt intuitive to me as a developer but might not be as clear to a user, making the feedback especially valuable for improving the user experience.\n",
