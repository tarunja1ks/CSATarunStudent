    "- User-understandable better since people generally didn't understand how the submission page worked as a whole until demoing more in depth\n",

    "- Java, I have been coding in it for 4-5 years now and the backend was a lot easier for me to do\n",
    "- js requests, since I now use it everywhere in my code\n",
    "- Modular code, which uses functions to make code shorter and easier\n",
    "- CSS Key animations, which was a lot of fun for me to make things move around\n",

I was able to use some of these skills to land a research position at UCSD, and to get reinvited by a professor back for some good work in the summer to do a full-time position and a more technical project. I want to do a lot of research in the future too on robotics but also CS too and how to apply it. I think it's cool about how hardware and software are able to integrate and want to even learn something like PCB designing.\n",
