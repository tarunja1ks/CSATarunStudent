I even got some oohs/awws from I believe 2 nighthawkcoders students about the deadline bouncing up and down which I think was a UI they liked. I also am a lot more familiar with database operations and springboot in Java right now, which is a huge improvement for me, as before I have never really worked on something like springboot, although some other cool projects. \n",

I was given feedback that it was a bit plain, and although I like plain better(I use to do some glows which seemed weird), it might not be to everyone's preference. Next time, I can possibly incorporate more sass and possibly even do style switching for what the user might prefer. "
