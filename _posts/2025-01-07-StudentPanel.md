Take notes that apply to yourself!

- I should learn more about taking multiple pieces of a project/combining them, as its important skill 
- I should do what I enjoy the most for college
- Understanding my code is important, even if I use something like chatgpt/copilot I should learn how code works especially if there are errors(In college this is especially important)
- Communication is key in whatever you do, since it’ll be a lot easier to gain more opportunities if I am organized and concise in my communication
- Flowcharting/planning is important especially for when you start to do big programs  
- Design reviews and etc are used in clubs so its important for me to stick to a more organized management better, as I can use it towards complicated things such as cars
- Do NOT do essays the night before 
-  I should try to Look at colleges based on what you like not based on what is ranked the highest
