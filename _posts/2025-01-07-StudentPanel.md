Take notes that apply to yourself!

- I should learn more about taking multiple pieces of a project/combining them, as its important skill 
- I should do what I enjoy the most for college
- Understanding my code is important, even if I use something like chatgpt/copilot I should learn how code works especially if there are errors(In college this is especially important)
- Communication is key in whatever you do, since it’ll be a lot easier to gain more opportunities if I am organized and concise in my communication
- Flowcharting/planning is important especially for when you start to do big programs  
- Design reviews and etc are used in clubs so its important for me to stick to a more organized management better, as I can use it towards complicated things such as cars
- Do NOT do essays the night before 
-  I should try to Look at colleges based on what you like not based on what is ranked the highest  

Key Takeaways/places i can use this:
- in my robotics team I am one of the co-captain and compared to last year, i tried to make us much more organized, which has made us significantly better being one of the top teams now, which confirms the statements said about organizing using structure/flowcharts more
- Reviews are pretty important, since sometimes I could not understand other people's code last year which
made debugging a lot harer when they presented a entire product with errors to help them fix rather than bits and pieces so I know more about what is going on
- I should try to follow my pasion and excel in that rather than getting peerpressured into doing somethign I don't like->life is short
